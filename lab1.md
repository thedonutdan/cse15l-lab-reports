# Lab 1 - File Systems

First command: `cd`  
We will run the `cd` command three times. First with a directory as an argument, second with a file as an argument, and
third with no argument.  
**`cd` with a directory as an argument**

Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd ..
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1/messages
[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd ~
[user@sahara ~]$ cd messages
bash: cd: messages: No such file or directory
```
In this example we can see that providing "lecture1" as an argument changes the working directory to "lecture1" and the same for "lecture1/messages" changing the working directory to "messages." However, when an invalid path is entered, an error is returned.  

**`cd` with a file as an argument**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ls
Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd Hello.java
bash: cd: Hello.java: Not a directory
```
Here we can see that using a filename as an argument for the cd command results in an error as `cd` will
only accept directories as arguments.  

**`cd` with no arguments**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
Here we can see `cd` returning the working directory to the home directory when no arguments are provided.  

Second Command: `ls`  
We will again run the `ls` command three times. One time with a directory as an argument, one time with a filename as an argument, and one time with no arguments.

**`ls` with a directory as an argument**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~]$ ls lecture1
Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README
[user@sahara ~]$ ls messages
ls: cannot access 'messages': No such file or directory
```
Here we an see `ls` listing the contents of directories as long as their path is valid and presenting an error when the command cannot find the directory.  

**`ls` with a filename as an argument**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ls Hello.java
Hello.java
```
Here we can see that when we give `ls` a valid filename as an argument the command will return the name of the file.  

**`ls` with no arguments**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ls
Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README
```
Here we can see that without arguments `ls` will print the contents of the present working directory.  

Third command: `cat`  
We will run the `cat` command three times. One with a directory as an argument, one with a filename as an argument, and one with no arguments.  

**`cat` with a directory as an argument**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cat messages
cat: messages: Is a directory
```
Here we can see that `cat` informs us that our target is a directory. It appears that this is not an error, but rather the command simply informs us what our target is, as a directory it has no text to print to the console. 

**`cat` with a filename as an argument**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cat Hello.java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;

public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    String content = Files.readString(Path.of(args[0]), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);    
    System.out.println(content);
  }
}[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ 
```
Here we can see that with a filename as an argument `cat` will print the contents of the file to the console.  

**`cat` with no arguments**  
Output:  
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cat


cat
cat
hello cat
hello cat
^C
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ^C
```
Here we can see that if `cat` is provided no arguments it effectively functions like an `echo` command, reprinting whatever is entered into the command line.
